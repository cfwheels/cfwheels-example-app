# Wheels Framework Examples

This directory contains example applications demonstrating common patterns and best practices for building applications with the Wheels framework.

## Examples

### 1. Blog Application (`/blog-app`)
A complete blog application demonstrating:
- User authentication and authorization

- File uploads for featured images

### 2. API Example (`/api-example`)
A RESTful API implementation showing:
- Token-based authentication

## Running the Examples

Each example includes its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally:

1. Navigate to the example directory
2. Copy the example to your workspace: `cp -r examples/blog-app ../workspace/`
3. Install dependencies: `box install`
4. Configure your database in `config/settings.cfm`
5. Run migrations: `wheels dbmigrate latest`
6. Start the server: `server start`

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Authentication**: Learn the basics of user management
2. **Move to Blog App**: Understand CRUD operations and associations
3. **Explore the API**: Learn about building RESTful services
