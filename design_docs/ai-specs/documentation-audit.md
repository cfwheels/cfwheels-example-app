# CFWheels 3.0 Documentation Audit & Rebranding Project

## Project Overview

Conduct a comprehensive audit of CFWheels 3.0 documentation while simultaneously implementing a rebranding from “CFWheels” to “Wheels” and updating domain references from “cfwheels.org” to “wheels.dev”. This is a multi-faceted project requiring systematic analysis, content updates, and quality assurance.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Complete Documentation Audit** - Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and improvements needed
1. **Rebranding Implementation** - Systematically change naming conventions and domain references
1. **Quality Assurance** - Ensure all changes maintain documentation integrity and accuracy
1. **Actionable Reporting** - Provide prioritized recommendations for the development team

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Agent 1: Documentation Structure Analyst

**Role**: Map and analyze the complete documentation ecosystem

**Tasks**:

- Clone and scan the `cfwheels/cfwheels` repository (focus on 3.0 branch if available)
- Identify all documentation files (.md, .cfm, .html, README files, etc.)
- Create a comprehensive directory structure map
- Catalog different documentation types:
  - User guides and tutorials
  - API documentation
  - Installation guides
  - Configuration documentation
  - Examples and code samples
- Identify documentation that lives outside the main repo (GitBook, external sites)

**Deliverables**:

- Complete documentation inventory with file paths
- Documentation type categorization
- External documentation source identification
- Structural analysis report

### Agent 2: Content Gap & Consistency Analyst

**Role**: Identify missing documentation and inconsistencies

**Tasks**:

- Cross-reference code functionality with existing documentation
- Identify undocumented features, methods, and configuration options
- Find inconsistent terminology and formatting
- Locate outdated information (version references, deprecated features)
- Check for incomplete documentation (stubs, TODOs, placeholder text)
- Analyze documentation depth and quality across different sections

**Special Focus Areas**:

- The `select()` form helper multiple attribute issue mentioned in GitHub issues
- Database migration documentation
- 3.0 directory structure changes
- New CLI features and commands

**Deliverables**:

- Gap analysis report with priority rankings
- Inconsistency log with specific locations
- Outdated content identification
- Missing documentation prioritization matrix

### Agent 3: Link Validation & Technical Audit Specialist

**Role**: Ensure all links work and technical accuracy

**Tasks**:

- Validate all internal links between documentation files
- Check external links (especially to cfwheels.org, GitHub, ForgeBox, etc.)
- Verify code examples compile and work correctly
- Check image references and embedded media
- Validate configuration examples and file paths
- Test installation and setup instructions

**Technical Validation**:

- Verify CommandBox installation commands
- Test database setup instructions
- Validate framework installation procedures
- Check all code samples for syntax accuracy

**Deliverables**:

- Broken link report with specific locations
- Technical accuracy assessment
- Code example validation results
- Installation instruction verification report

### Agent 4: Rebranding Implementation Specialist

**Role**: Execute the CFWheels → Wheels rebrand systematically

**Tasks**:

- Find all instances of “CFWheels” and determine appropriate replacement with “Wheels”
- Locate all “cfwheels.org” references for replacement with “wheels.dev”
- Handle edge cases and context-sensitive replacements:
  - Repository names (cfwheels/cfwheels)
  - Package names and namespaces
  - Historical references that should remain unchanged
  - Code examples and variable names
  - URLs and domain references

**Replacement Strategy**:

- “CFWheels” → “Wheels” (in most contexts)
- “cfwheels.org” → “wheels.dev”
- “github.com/cfwheels/” → Keep as-is (repository URLs)
- Context-sensitive handling for:
  - Code examples with variable names
  - Historical blog posts or changelogs
  - Configuration file references

**Deliverables**:

- Complete rebranding change log
- Context-sensitive replacement rules
- Files requiring manual review
- Automated replacement script (if applicable)

### Agent 5: Quality Assurance & Integration Coordinator

**Role**: Ensure all changes maintain quality and integrate properly

**Tasks**:

- Review all proposed changes from other agents
- Identify potential conflicts between rebranding and technical accuracy
- Ensure documentation maintains professional tone and consistency
- Verify that rebranding doesn’t break technical functionality
- Coordinate final deliverables from all agents
- Create implementation priority matrix

**Quality Checks**:

- Spelling and grammar review
- Technical accuracy after rebranding
- Link integrity post-changes
- Documentation flow and user experience
- Consistency in terminology and style

**Deliverables**:

- Final quality assessment report
- Integrated change recommendations
- Implementation roadmap with priorities
- Risk assessment for proposed changes

## Specific Requirements

### Repository Structure

- Primary focus: `cfwheels/cfwheels` main repository
- Special attention to 3.0 branch/version if separate
- Include `/guides` folder if present in repository
- Check for documentation in `/docs`, `/readme`, `/examples` folders

### Rebranding Specifications

- **Product Name**: “CFWheels” → “Wheels”
- **Domain**: “cfwheels.org” → “wheels.dev”
- **Preserve**: GitHub repository URLs, package names where needed for functionality
- **Context Sensitivity**: Maintain historical accuracy in changelogs/release notes

### Priority Issues to Address

Based on known issues:

1. Missing documentation for `select()` form helper multiple attribute
1. Broken documentation links
1. 3.0 directory structure documentation
1. CLI command documentation
1. Migration guide accuracy

## Final Deliverables Expected

### Comprehensive Audit Report

1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and recommended priorities
1. **Documentation Inventory** - Complete catalog of all documentation
1. **Gap Analysis** - Missing documentation with priority rankings
1. **Technical Issues** - Broken links, outdated content, technical errors
1. **Rebranding Implementation Plan** - Systematic approach to name/domain changes
1. **Quality Metrics** - Current state assessment and improvement targets

### Actionable Implementation Files

1. **Prioritized Issue List** - Specific files and line numbers needing changes
1. **Rebranding Change Script** - Automated replacements where safe
1. **Manual Review List** - Items requiring human judgment
1. **Documentation Templates** - For creating missing documentation
1. **Style Guide Updates** - Incorporating new branding standards

### Progress Tracking Tools

1. **Implementation Checklist** - Trackable tasks for the development team
1. **Before/After Comparison** - Key improvements achieved
1. **Ongoing Maintenance Plan** - Preventing future documentation debt

## Success Criteria

- Zero broken internal links
- Complete documentation for all 3.0 features
- Consistent “Wheels” branding throughout
- All wheels.dev domain references correct
- Clear, actionable improvement roadmap for development team
- Documentation that reduces support burden and improves developer onboarding

## Agent Coordination Notes

- Each agent should maintain a shared findings log
- Cross-reference discoveries between agents
- Final integration should resolve any conflicting recommendations
- Prioritize changes that have immediate impact on developer experience
