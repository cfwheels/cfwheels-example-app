## Use Cases

### 1. Environment Verification
Before deployment or when debugging:
```bash
wheels about
```
Check that:
- Correct Wheels version is installed
- Environment is set properly
- Database is configured

### 2. New Team Member Onboarding
Help new developers understand:
- Application structure (controllers, models, views count)
- Development environment setup
- Where to find documentation

### 3. Troubleshooting
When reporting issues:
```bash
wheels about > environment-info.txt
```
Share the output to provide complete context.

### 4. Project Documentation
Include output in project README to document:
- Required Wheels version
- CFML engine requirements
- Application structure overview

## Environment Detection

The command detects the environment through:
1. `server.json` WHEELS_ENV setting
2. System environment variable WHEELS_ENV
3. Default to "development" if not set

## Database Configuration

Database status is determined by checking:
1. `config/settings.cfm` for datasource settings
2. `.env` file for database environment variables
3. Presence of database-related configuration

## Statistics Collection

Statistics are gathered by counting files in:
- `/app/controllers/*.cfc` - Controllers
- `/app/models/*.cfc` - Models
- `/app/views/**/*.cfm` - Views
- `/tests/**/*.cfc` - Tests
- `/db/migrate/*.cfc` - Migrations

## Related Commands

- [`wheels version`](../core/info.md#version) - Show just version information
- [`wheels doctor`](doctor.md) - Run health checks
- [`wheels stats`](stats.md) - Detailed code statistics
- [`wheels env`](../environment/env.md) - Manage environments

## Tips

- Run `wheels about` when starting work on an unfamiliar project
- Include output in bug reports for better troubleshooting
- Use to verify environment after deployment
- Check before upgrading Wheels or CFML engine

## Customization

The application name is read from:
```cfml
// Application.cfc
this.name = "MyWheelsApp";
```

Environment can be set via:
```json
// server.json
{
  "env": {
    "WHEELS_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Information

If some information is missing:
- **Application Name**: Check Application.cfc has `this.name` set
- **Database Status**: Ensure database configuration exists
- **Statistics**: Verify directory structure follows Wheels conventions

### Permission Issues

If statistics can't be calculated:
- Check read permissions on application directories
- Ensure you're running from application root
