Detailed File Analysis
======================================================================
Largest Files (by LOC):
  1. app/models/User.cfc (450 LOC)
  2. app/controllers/Admin.cfc (380 LOC)
  3. tests/models/UserTest.cfc (350 LOC)
  4. app/models/Product.cfc (320 LOC)
  5. app/controllers/Products.cfc (290 LOC)
  6. public/javascripts/application.js (280 LOC)
  7. app/models/Order.cfc (250 LOC)
  8. tests/integration/CheckoutTest.cfc (240 LOC)
  9. app/controllers/Api.cfc (220 LOC)
  10. public/stylesheets/main.css (200 LOC)
```

## Metrics Explained

### File Types

- **Controllers**: Application controllers (*.cfc in /app/controllers)
- **Models**: Domain models (*.cfc in /app/models)
- **Views**: View templates (*.cfm in /app/views)
- **Helpers**: Helper functions (*.cfc in /app/helpers)
- **Tests**: Test files (*.cfc in /tests)
- **Migrations**: Database migrations (*.cfc in /db/migrate)
- **Config**: Configuration files (*.cfm, *.cfc in /config)
- **Javascripts**: JavaScript files (*.js in /public/javascripts)
- **Stylesheets**: CSS/SCSS files (*.css, *.scss, *.sass in /public/stylesheets)

### Statistics Columns

- **Files**: Number of files of this type
- **Lines**: Total lines including blanks and comments
- **LOC**: Lines of Code (actual code, excluding comments and blanks)
- **Comments**: Lines containing comments
- **Blank**: Empty lines

### Code Metrics

- **Code to Test Ratio**: Ratio of test LOC to application code LOC
- **Average Lines per File**: Total lines divided by file count
- **Average LOC per File**: Total LOC divided by file count
- **Comment Percentage**: Percentage of comments to total code

## Comment Detection

The command recognizes different comment styles:

### CFML Comments
```cfml
// Single line comment
<!--- Multi-line
      comment --->
```

### JavaScript Comments
```javascript
// Single line comment
/* Multi-line
   comment */
```

### CSS Comments
```css
/* CSS comment */
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Project Health Assessment
```bash
wheels stats
```
Check:
- Test coverage ratio (aim for 1:1 or higher)
- Comment percentage (5-15% is typical)
- File size distribution

### 2. Code Review Preparation
```bash
wheels stats verbose=true
```
Identify:
- Largest files that may need refactoring
- Areas with low test coverage
- Files lacking documentation

### 3. Project Documentation
```bash
wheels stats > project-stats.txt
```
Include in documentation to show:
- Project size and complexity
- Test coverage metrics
- Code organization

### 4. Refactoring Targets
Use verbose mode to find:
- Oversized files (>300 LOC)
- Controllers/models that do too much
- Areas needing more tests

## Best Practices

### Ideal Metrics

- **Code to Test Ratio**: 1:1 or higher
- **Average LOC per File**: 100-200 lines
- **Comment Percentage**: 5-15%
- **Largest Files**: Under 500 LOC

### Warning Signs

- Test ratio below 1:0.5 (50% coverage)
- Files over 500 LOC
- Comment percentage below 3%
- Controllers larger than models

## Interpreting Results

### Good Signs
- High test coverage (1:1 or better)
- Consistent file sizes
- Adequate comments
- More view files than controllers (proper MVC separation)

### Areas for Improvement
- Low test coverage (below 1:0.5)
- Very large files (over 500 LOC)
- Low comment percentage (under 3%)
- More controller code than model code

## Performance

The command efficiently analyzes files by:
- Reading files once
- Processing in memory
- Skipping binary files
- Ignoring vendor/modules directories

## Related Commands

- [`wheels about`](about.md) - General application information
- [`wheels notes`](notes.md) - Extract code annotations
- [`wheels test:coverage`](../testing/test-coverage.md) - Actual test coverage
- [`wheels analyze code`](../analysis/analyze-code.md) - Code quality analysis

## Tips

- Run regularly to track code growth
- Use verbose mode to identify refactoring candidates
- Compare stats before and after major features
- Set team standards for file sizes and test coverage

## Limitations

- LOC counting is line-based, not statement-based
- Test coverage ratio is based on LOC, not actual code coverage
- Comments in strings may be counted as comments
- Doesn't analyze code complexity or quality

## File Filters

The command uses these patterns:
- Controllers: `*.cfc` in `/app/controllers`
- Models: `*.cfc` in `/app/models`
- Views: `*.cfm` in `/app/views`
- Tests: `*.cfc` in `/tests`
- JavaScript: `*.js` in `/public/javascripts`
- CSS: `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.sass` in `/public/stylesheets`
