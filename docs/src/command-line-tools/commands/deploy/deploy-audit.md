# deploy audit

Audit deployment configuration and security settings to ensure compliance and best practices.

## Synopsis

```bash
wheels deploy audit [options]
```

## Description

The `wheels deploy audit` command performs a comprehensive security and configuration audit of your deployment setup. It checks for common misconfigurations, security vulnerabilities, and compliance issues in your deployment environment.

## Options

- `--environment, -e` - Target environment to audit (default: production)
- `--report-format` - Output format for audit report (json, html, text) (default: text)
- `--output, -o` - Save audit report to file
- `--severity` - Minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high, critical)
- `--fix` - Attempt to automatically fix issues where possible
- `--verbose, -v` - Show detailed audit information

## Examples

### Basic audit
```bash
wheels deploy audit
```

### Audit staging environment
```bash
wheels deploy audit --environment staging
```

### Generate HTML report
```bash
wheels deploy audit --report-format html --output audit-report.html
```

### Show only high severity issues
```bash
wheels deploy audit --severity high
```

### Auto-fix issues
```bash
wheels deploy audit --fix
```

## Audit Checks

The command performs the following audit checks:

### Security
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Exposed sensitive files
- Default credentials
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization settings
- Input validation
- Session management
- Error handling

### Configuration
- Environment variables
- Database connections
- API endpoints
- File permissions
- Resource limits
- Logging configuration
- Backup settings
- Monitoring setup

### Compliance
- Data protection requirements
- Access control policies
- Audit trail completeness
- Retention policies
- Encryption standards

## Output

The audit generates a detailed report including:

- Summary of findings
- Issue severity levels
- Affected components
- Remediation recommendations
- Compliance status
- Performance metrics

## Use Cases

### Pre-deployment audit
```bash
# Run comprehensive audit before deploying
wheels deploy audit --severity low
wheels deploy push --if-audit-passes
```

### Scheduled audits
```bash
# Run regular audits in CI/CD
wheels deploy audit --output reports/audit-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Compliance reporting
```bash
# Generate compliance report
wheels deploy audit --report-format html --output compliance.html
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular audits**: Run audits regularly, not just before deployments
2. **Fix critical issues**: Always address critical and high severity issues
3. **Document exceptions**: Keep records of accepted risks and exceptions
4. **Automate checks**: Integrate audits into your CI/CD pipeline
5. **Review reports**: Have security team review audit reports

## Integration

The audit command integrates with:

- CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks
- Monitoring systems for continuous compliance
- Issue tracking systems for remediation workflow
- Reporting tools for compliance documentation
