# Wheels Example Application - Detailed Overview

## 🚀 What This Is

This repository contains a **user management and authentication web application** built with the [Wheels](https://wheels.dev/) framework (version 3.x), a modern MVC framework inspired by Ruby on Rails. The app demonstrates best practices for Wheels 3.0, including security, conventions, and a modern UI using Bootstrap.

**⚠️ Important**: This is **not a complete, full-featured app**, but rather a **skeleton/example app** built with Wheels 3.x. It is designed to help you get started and to showcase best practices in authentication, authorization, auditing, and modern web UI using Wheels.

## ✨ Key Features

### User Registration & Verification
- Users can register through a secure registration form
- Email verification system sends verification emails to new users
- Account activation only after email verification is complete

### Authentication
- Secure login and logout functionality
- Password reset system via email
- **Note**: Brute-force protection is marked as TODO in the codebase

### Account Management
- Authenticated users can view their account details
- Users can update their profile information (name, email)
- Password change functionality with current password verification

### Admin Panel
Admin users have access to comprehensive management features:

**User Management:**
- Create new users
- Edit existing user details
- Disable/soft delete users
- Permanently delete users
- Recover disabled users
- Reset user passwords (generates new temp password via email)
- **Assume User Identity**: Login as another user for troubleshooting (high-privilege feature)

**Role & Permission Management:**
- Manage roles (create, edit, delete)
- Manage permissions
- Assign/remove permissions for users and roles
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation

**System Administration:**
- View and filter audit logs for security tracking
- Manage application settings
- Monitor user activities

### Security Features
- **CSRF Protection** on all forms using Wheels built-in protection
- **Input validation and sanitization** on all user inputs
- **Role and permission checks** for all admin actions
- **Audit logging** for sensitive actions and changes
- **Secure password handling** with bcrypt hashing

### Email Notifications
- Account verification emails for new registrations
- Password reset emails for forgotten passwords
- Admin password reset notifications when admins reset user passwords

### Modern UI
- **Bootstrap 4** for clean, responsive design
- All forms and navigation use Wheels helpers for consistency and security
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Consistent styling across all pages

## 🎯 Intended Audience

- **Developers** looking for a reference or starter app for Wheels 3.x
- **Teams** wanting to learn or demonstrate best practices in Wheels MVC development
- **Students** learning modern CFML web development
- **Organizations** evaluating Wheels framework for their projects

box server start
```

### Environment Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure database settings based on your chosen database:

#### MySQL Configuration
```bash
DB_TYPE=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=exampleapp
DB_USER=youruser
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### Login Process
1. User submits credentials
2. System validates against database
3. Session created with user data
4. Permissions loaded based on role
5. User redirected to appropriate dashboard
